# Machine-learning---Decision tree classifier


The aim of this work is the realization of a Python program allowing seeing underfitting and overfitting through the decision trees. The program also allows the deduction of the ideal number of leaves for the decision tree. 

The program uses a dataset named "Wisconsin breast cancer" and allows the construction of a decision tree with 2 leaves and 30 leaves. The calculation of the average accuracy was made on the training set and on the test set showing that there is underfitting for the 2-leaf tree and overfitting for the 30-leaf tree. 

In order to select the ideal number of leaves, the average accuracy of the decision trees ranging from 2 to 30 leaves was calculated and plotted on a graph for the training set and the test set. Thanks to this graph, it was found that the ideal number of leaves for the decision tree is 6.
